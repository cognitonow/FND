# Build Journey

This document tracks the features we've built and the steps taken to implement them.

1.  **Initial Setup**: Project started with a Next.js boilerplate, including basic page structure and UI components from ShadCN.

2.  **Firebase Integration & Debugging**:
    *   Encountered a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error from Firestore.
    *   **Action**: Connected the application to a new Firebase project to resolve credential issues.
    *   Encountered a `NOT_FOUND` error from Firestore.
    *   **Action**: Manually created the Firestore database instance via the Firebase Console and set it to test mode.

3.  **Admin UI & Layout Fixes**:
    *   Addressed a bug causing a blank admin page due to incorrect authentication handling.
    *   Disabled authentication requirement for the admin section to simplify development.
    *   Fixed layout issues where the main site header was overlapping the admin panel content.

4.  **AI-Powered Article Generation from YouTube**:
    *   The initial implementation used a scraping tool (`yt-dlp`) which proved unreliable, leading to "unable to retrieve video details" errors.
    *   **Action**: Refactored the feature to use the official YouTube Data API v3 for robust and reliable video data fetching.
    *   **Action**: Integrated the `googleapis` library and created a new YouTube service to handle API requests.
    *   **Action**: Updated the Genkit flow to explicitly call the new YouTube service before calling the AI prompt, making the logic more reliable.
    *   **Action**: Required the user to enable the YouTube Data API in Google Cloud Console and add the API key to the project's environment variables.
    *   **Result**: The "Generate from YouTube" feature is now fully functional, successfully creating article drafts from public YouTube videos.

5.  **YouTube Video Embedding**:
    *   Successfully implemented the feature where a YouTube video is automatically embedded in articles generated from a URL.
    *   **Challenge**: Initially, the `<YoutubeVideo>` tag generated by the AI was not being correctly parsed and rendered by the `ArticleContent` frontend component.
    *   **Solution**: After several attempts to fix the parsing logic with regular expressions, the solution was to simplify both the AI's output and the component's logic. We modified the AI prompt to produce a clean, predictable tag and rewrote the `ArticleContent` component to directly find and replace this tag, making the system much more robust.

6.  **Dynamic Toolset Logo Integration**:
    *   Implemented a "Toolset" card to display logos of the user's technical skills.
    *   **Challenge**: Logos from the third-party service `img.logo.dev` were not displaying, despite the URLs being correct.
    *   **Solution**: The issue was resolved in two parts:
        *   First, the domain `img.logo.dev` was added to the `images.remotePatterns` array in `next.config.ts`. This is a required security step to allow Next.js's `<Image>` component to load images from external sources.
        *   Second, the publishable API key provided by the user was appended as a `token` query parameter to each logo URL, which was required for the `logo.dev` service to authorize the request from within the application.
